PiggyBankService
================

A service to deposit and withdraw money into a fake bank.

Services:

Money must be positive or the service will not accept the input

Objects must be passed as required XML objects.

deposit/withdrawl will return a boolean of the services success/failure.
getMoney returns XML object.

Able to run this with a databse, currently using a the projects hosted bak object to hold balance.
